# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [RAID Reliability Calculator](https://www.servethehome.com/raid-calculator/raid-reliability-calculator-simple-mttdl-model/)<br>
One thing we have been working on for quite some time is getting a working model for doing simple MTTDL calculations on the web.
There are more elegant models that one can use versus a simple Poisson distribution for sure, and it does not take into account other parts failing such as disk controllers, motherboards, power supplies and etc. It took a lot of back and forth but the basic idea is this, the calculator is “directionally” correct but is not the most accurate way to model all of that stuff.

2. [What is RAID?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/raid-redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks/)<br>
RAID, or “Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks” is a technique which makes use of a combination of multiple disks instead of using a single disk for increased performance, data redundancy or both.

3. [What is GRUB?](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-grub/)<br>
this article will tell you what Grub is and what is it used for and also briefly touch upon the configuration and customization part.
GRUB is a complete program for loading and managing the boot process. It is the most common bootloader for Linux distributions.

4. [Disk Attachment](http://www.faadooengineers.com/online-study/post/cse/operating-system/275/disk-attachment)<br>
Computers access disk storage in two ways. One way is via I/O ports (or host-attached storage); this is common on small systems. The other way is via a remote host in a distributed file system; this is referred to as network-attached storage.

5. [Disk Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling.

6. [SCAN (Elevator) Disk Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scan-elevator-disk-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
In SCAN disk scheduling algorithm, head starts from one end of the disk and moves towards the other end, servicing requests in between one by one and reach the other end. Then the direction of the head is reversed and the process continues as head continuously scan back and forth to access the disk. 

7. [What is a storage area network?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/storage-area-network)<br>
A storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated network tailored to a specific environment, combining servers, storage systems, networking switches, software, and services.

8. [BIOS](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/bios.htm)<br>
Short for Basic Input/Output System, the BIOS (pronounced bye-oss) is a ROM chip found on motherboards that allows you to access and set up your computer system at the most basic level. The picture below is an example of what a BIOS chip may look like on a computer motherboard.

9. [What is an ACPI BIOS?](https://zebratechnologies.force.com/s/article/What-is-ACPI?language=en_US)<br>
ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is an industry specification for the efficient handling of power consumption in desktop and mobile computers. ACPI specifies how a computer's BIOS, operating system, and peripheral devices communicate with each other about power usage. ACPI is a key component of Intel's "Instantly Available" technology.

10. [UEFI vs BIOS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/uefi-vs-bios/)<br>
So you might have heard the acronyms BIOS and UEFI thrown around, especially when trying to switch Operating Systems or messing around with overclocking.
And you might know what these acronyms stand for (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface and Basic Input/Output System, respectively). But have you ever wondered how they're used in a computer system?
