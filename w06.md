# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Multithreading Models](https://binaryterms.com/multithreading-models-in-operating-system.html#:~:text=Many%20to%20One%20multithreading%20model,equal%20number%20of%20kernel%20threads.)<br>
Many to One multithreading model maps many user threads to only one kernel thread. One to One multithreading model maps a single user thread to a single kernel thread. Many to Many multithreading models maps many user threads to a lesser or equal number of kernel threads.

2. [fork() and exec() System Calls (VIDEO)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFEFVXvjiHY)<br>
Every application(program) comes into execution through means of process, process is a running instance of a program. Processes are created through different system calls, most popular are fork() and exec().

3. [Process Management in Operating System: PCB in OS](https://www.guru99.com/process-management-pcb.html)<br>
Process operations can be easily controlled with the help of PCB(Process Control Block). You can consider it as the brain of the process, which contains all the crucial information related to processing like process id, priority, state, CPU registers, etc.

4. [Inter Process Communication (IPC)a](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)<br>
An operating system can implement both methods of communication. First, this article discuss the shared memory methods of communication and then message passing. Communication between processes using shared memory requires processes to share some variable, and it completely depends on how the programmer will implement it. 

5. [Concurrency vs. Parallelism](https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/concurrency-vs-parallelism-a-brief-review-b337c8dac350#:~:text=Concurrency%20is%20about%20dealing%20with,at%20the%20same%20time%20instant.)<br>
Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

6. [Concurrency in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)<br>
Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel. 
Concurrency results in sharing of resources result in problems like deadlocks and resources starvation.It helps in techniques like coordinating execution of processes, memory allocation and execution scheduling for maximizing throughput.

7. [Multicore system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/challanges-in-programming-for-multicore-system/)<br>
Multicore System consists of two or more processors which have been attached to a single chip to enhance performance, reduce power consumption, and more efficient simultaneous processing of multiple tasks. Multicore system has been in recent trend where each core appears as a separate processor.

8. [Exec System Call in C](https://linuxhint.com/exec_linux_system_call_c/)<br>
In this article, I am going talk about the exec family of functions and show you how to use each one of these exec family function in C.

9. [Memory mapped I/O and Isolated I/O](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-mapped-i-o-and-isolated-i-o/)<br>
As a CPU needs to communicate with the various memory and input-output devices (I/O) as we know data between the processor and these devices flow with the help of the system bus.

10. [I/O scheduling in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/i-o-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Scheduling is used for efficient usage of computer resources avoiding deadlock and serving all processes waiting in the queue. To know more about CPU Scheduling refer to CPU Scheduling in Operating Systems.
