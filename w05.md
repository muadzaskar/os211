# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory#:~:text=Virtual%20memory%20is%20a%20very,(RAM)%20to%20disk%20storage.)<br>
Virtual memory is a memory management technique where secondary memory can be used as if it were a part of the main memory. How virtual memory works,Virtual memory uses both computer hardware and software to work.

2. [What is Virtual Memory? (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2quKyPnUShQ)<br>
That video contains an Introduction about virtual memory works in OS and how virtual memory works.

3. [Cache Memory](https://www.itpro.co.uk/hardware/30353/what-is-cache-memory)<br>
This article explain the different categories of cache memory and how it differs from RAM.

4. [Memory Hierarchy](https://www.studytonight.com/computer-architecture/memory-organization)<br>
A memory unit is the collection of storage units or devices together. The memory unit stores the binary information in the form of bits.

5. [Allocation of frames in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
An important aspect of operating systems, virtual memory is implemented using demand paging. Demand paging necessitates the development of a page-replacement algorithm and a frame allocation algorithm. 

6. [Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) in Paging]()<br>
 Operating System (Memory Management Technique : Paging), for each process page table will be created, which will contain Page Table Entry (PTE).

7. [Page Replacement Algorithms](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-are-the-page-replacement-algorithms)<br>
This article will introduce you to the concept of page replacement, which is used in memory management. You will understand the definition, need and various algorithms related to page replacement.

8. [Operating System Kernel](ssla.co.uk/operating-system-kernel/)<br>
A kernel is the core of any computer system which has full control over the systems performance. This basic core of an operating system is always present at any time.

9. [UMA and NUMA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/non-uniform-memory-access)<br>
UMA and NUMA stand for uniform memory access and non-uniform memory access, respectively. The terms are most often used in the context of higher order memory systems and not specifically cache systems, but they are useful designations in the discussion of distributed/partitioned caches because UMA/NUMA systems illustrate the main issues of dealing with physically disjoint memories.

10. [Thrashing and Working Sets](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs140-spring14/lecture.php?topic=thrashing)<br>
This article explain : What happens if memory gets overcommitted? How to deal with thrashing? Page fault frequency: one technique for computing working sets.
