# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Static vs Shared Libraries (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vp9cFQCQCo)<br>
This video will cover: Why to use a library in programming? Difference between static & shared Library, Advantages & Disadvantages of static library, Advantages & Disadvantages of shared library

2. [Difference between Static and Shared libraries](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-static-and-shared-libraries)<br>
In programming context library is something which has some sort of that code which is pre compiled and could get reused in any program for some specific functionality or feature. Now on the basis of execution and storage of this code library is classified in two types i.e Static library and Shared library. This article will cover the important differences between Static library and Shared library.

3. [Global variables and local variables (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vp9cFQCQCo)<br>
As we know, the system defines some variables for us; one of those variables is the PATH variable; this variable holds some paths.These paths are the default paths that the shell uses to look for a command when you type it in the shell. This article guide you to declare Local Variables, Global Variables, and Modifying the PATH Environment Variable. 

4. [Local, Global and Static variables in C](https://overiq.com/c-programming-101/local-global-and-static-variables-in-c/)<br>
The variables which are declared inside the function, compound statement (or block) are called Local variables. Unlike local variables, global variables are not destroyed as soon as the function ends. They are available to any function until the program is executing.A Static variable is able to retain its value between different function calls. The static variable is only initialized once, if it is not initialized, then it is automatically initialized to 0.

5. [Memory addresses (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzMCuw_5dfM)<br>
This video, which examines key computational abstraction levels below modern high-level languages. From Java/C to assembly programming, to basic processor and system organization.

6. [The Basics Of Memory and Addresses](https://www.scottklement.com/rpg/pointers.html)<br>
Every computer contains "storage" that is used to store programs, files, variables, etc. This storage (which we will also be referring to as "memory", even though it could actually be disk space on any modern operating system) is usually numbered, so that each byte within it has a unique address.

7. [Introduction to Memory Management in Linux (Video Conference)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aONIVSXiJ8)<br>
This presentation will describe the different types of virtual memory spaces and mappings used in the Linux kernel, the cases in which they are useful, how they are implemented in the kernel, and how they differ from user space memory. 

8. [How to Manage Linux Memory](https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/memory-management-linux#:~:text=Commands%20for%20Memory%20Management%20in%20Linux%201%20%2Fproc%2Fmeminfo.,in%20the%20system.%20...%204%20vmstat%20command.%20)<br>
In this article, well cover the basic commands for memory management in Linux. Memory management is a vast topic and covering it in one blog post will not do it justice. In this tutorial, we will mainly go over the commands that you can use to observe your memory statistics.

9. [What is Linux swap? (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgefj9ibRE)<br>
 In the video, I cover these key points: What is Linux Swap? Do you need Linux Swap? What are Swap Partition and swap file? How to create a Swap File? What is swappiness and how to adjust it?

10. [Swapping in OS](https://prepinsta.com/operating-systems/swapping/#:~:text=Swapping%20is%20a%20simple%20memory%20or%20process%20management,data%20in%20and%20out%20of%20the%20main%20memory.)<br>
Swapping is a simple memory or process management method used by the operating system (O.S). This method is dedicated to increasing the utilization of the processor by moving blocks of data in and out of the main memory. This data and information are swapped between the main and the secondary memory to optimize memory utilization and increase the processing power.
